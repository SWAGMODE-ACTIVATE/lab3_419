function handle = drawEllipse(a, b, x0, y0, phi,col);

%   drawEllipse draws an ellipse with characteristics given by the user.
%   The function returns 'handle', which can then be used to further 
%   customize the ellipse.

%   Input parameters:
%       a           Semi-major axis
%       b           Semi-minor axis
%       x0          X coordinate of the ellipse centre
%       y0          Y coordinate of the ellipse centre
%       phi         Angle between x-axis and the major axis IN DEGREES
%
%   Output:
%       handle      Handle of the plotted object
%
%   Examples of use:
%   drawEllipse(2, 4);  - semi-major and semi-minor axes with no rotation or translation
%   drawEllipse(2, 4, 90);  - semi-major, semi-minor and rotation as input and no translation
%   drawEllipse(2, 4, 10, 10);  - semi-major, semi-minor, x0 and y0 as input and no rotation
%   drawEllipse(2, 4, 10, 10, 90);  - semi-major, semi-minor, x0, y0 and rotation as input
%   
%   %% To draw more than more ellipse on the same plot:
%   figure;
%   hold on;
%   drawEllipse(2, 4);          % draw the first ellipse on the figure
%   drawEllipse(2, 4, 10, 10);  % draw a second ellipse on the figure
%   hold off;
%   %% You should now have a figure with two ellipses on it, which you can
%   scale to the dimensions of your network by clicking on the Figure menu
%   bar: "Tools", and toggle Edit Plot on.  Then double click on the axes 
%   and turn off Auto limits.
